## About This Project

### ASCII Art Converter

This project allows the creation of images from text using an ASCII art converter. It is a simple sized image to ASCII character based art. The Python Imaging Library comes in handy in this activity to do image manipulations such as resizing or altering to mono. The main aim of the project addresses the pixels brightness by giving them an ASCII representation in the picture.

### Features

- **Image Resizing**: The application resizes input images while maintaining the original aspect ratio, ensuring that the final ASCII art representation is proportionate.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Images are converted to grayscale to simplify brightness mapping, enabling a more accurate ASCII character representation.
- **Brightness Mapping**: Each pixel's brightness level is mapped to an ASCII character from a predefined set, creating a textured output that resembles the original image.
- **ASCII Art Display**: The resulting ASCII art is displayed in a new window, providing a unique way to visualize images as text.

### Usage

To use this project:
1. Install the required libraries.
2. Place your image file in the project directory.
3. Run the script to generate the ASCII art representation of your image.
4. Enjoy the ASCII art output displayed in a new window.

### Technologies Used

- Python
